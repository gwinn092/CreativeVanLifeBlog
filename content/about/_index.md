LIFE ON THE ROAD

Everyone dreams of the day when they can live worry free. Nothing tying you down, just the freedom to do whatever you want. See new places, meet new people, try new things, and the ability to create a surrounding that is totally unique to each of us. If we just work hard enough, save all the money, and make a plan, it will all work out down the road, right? I’m a firm believer that sometimes you just have to wing it.  If you can just let go of what you think your life is supposed to be, you might just be able to find what makes you happy. Isn’t that what it’s all really about? 

A LITTLE ABOUT US
I grew up traveling with my grandparents when I was young. We did everything from cross country road trips, to camping and hiking to glaciers. They instilled the travel bug in me at a young age, and I’m so very grateful for that. I would always hear them talking about this grand plan to retire, buy a new RV, and travel the country. They had it all mapped out, the places they wanted to go and the things they wanted to see. I watched my grandparents both get sick and pass away before ever getting to live the life they always wanted. It was then that my ideas about life and what I wanted to accomplish began to change.                                                                                                      	 Why wait and save in hopes that someday I could embark on the adventure of my dreams. Why not live my whole life like I really want? I dream of the open road and no plans. I love the feeling of just trusting in the universe and taking the leap. So far, things have always worked out for the best.                                                               I spur the moment decided to move from St. John in the Caribbean to Denver, Colorado. Denver is where I met Jesse, My adventure partner and the love of my life. He was born and raised in Denver, and has travelled a lot as a young adult. My first year in Denver was full of camping, hiking, and road trips. I saw more of Colorado than most people who grew up in that state, thanks to my very own local guide. We quickly realized that we had a shared love for new adventures. Trying to figure out our next move, and skyrocketing rent is what brought up the discussion of van life. I think Jesse mentioned it the first time as a joke, but something stuck. It just kept coming up, and the more we talked about it, the more it just kind of made sense. It was one of those things, we just had to take the risk and see how it all turned out. Trust in the universe, right? Instead of signing another year lease, we bought a 2017 Dodge Promaster and decided to make it our home on the road.
